                We are a super trustworthy, and not creepy in any way, company
                filled with love for green paper. Established in 2015, we gained
                support quickly and our wonderful Kool-Aid started changing lives.
                We want to thank all of our supporters, even though they aren't
                with us anymore.

                I have a direct line to God and have his explicit blessing to
                create this wonderful drink and bring his sheeple back to him in
                the afterlife.

                I am the moral support for the amazing leader that is my husband.
                His communion with God is a miracle and everyone should be able
                to take advantage of his divine greatness. Kool-Aid for the win!
